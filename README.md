# VIA CEP API LEARNING

## About
This project is about learning how to interact and use API methods. The whole project was developed by Alura, besides the javascript. The purpose of this project was to learn and practice my recent knowledge about API. I was lectured about ".then" and the "callback hell", also learned about "try", "catch", "finally", Promise and async functions.

## Tech
- JavaScript
